This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(lattice)
library(tidyverse)
train <- read_csv("~/Downloads/train.csv")
```

```{r}
sapply(train, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

Hence, we see 29 different variable in the given dataset.

```{r}
##The distinct cancellation_policy are recorded
train %>% group_by(cancellation_policy) %>% select(cancellation_policy) %>% unique()

```



```{r}
##Only 10 different distinct property_types are recorded
train %>% group_by(property_type) %>% select(property_type) %>% unique()
count(train, property_type) %>% mutate(relative_freq = (n/sum(n)))
train %>% group_by(property_type) %>% select(property_type, log_price) %>%filter(property_type=="Apartment" | property_type =="Bed & Breakfast" | property_type =="Bungalow" | property_type == "Condominium" | property_type == "House" | property_type == "Loft" | property_type == "Townhouse") -> modified_property_type
count(modified_property_type, property_type) 


```

```{r}
##Those selected property_types were studied through the use of boxplot to see their relationship with log_price 
ggplot(modified_property_type, aes(x= property_type, y=log_price))+geom_boxplot()+ ggtitle("Boxplot for log_price vs property_type")
```

```{r}
##All the 5 different cancellation_policy were studied to see their relationship with log_price through the use of box plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(train, aes(x= cancellation_policy, y=log_price))+geom_boxplot()+ ggtitle("Boxplot for log_price vs cancellation_policy")
```

```{r}
##Three different room_types were studied and each of their relative frequency is calculated to find their individual share
train %>% group_by(room_type) %>% select(room_type) %>% unique()
count(train, room_type) %>% mutate(relative_freq = (n/sum(n)))

```

```{r}
##Those 3 kinds of room_types were studied through the use of boxplot to see their relationship with log_price 
ggplot(train, aes(x= room_type, y=log_price))+geom_boxplot()+ ggtitle("Boxplot for log_price vs room_type")

```

```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(~room_type + instant_bookable, data = train, shade = TRUE)

```

From above mosaic plot we see, the two-tiles shaped deep blue correspond to only one cell having shared room_type and true instant_bookable whose residuals are greater than +4 indicating much greater frequency in this cell than would be found if the hypothesis of independence. The two-tile shaped  having shared room_type with false instant_bookable  and entire home/apt room_type with true instant_bookable corresponds to the residuals between -2.0 and -3.7 which indicates the combination is extremely rare under the hypothesis of independence.

```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(~cleaning_fee + city, data = train, shade = TRUE)
mosaic(~city + cleaning_fee, data = train, shade = TRUE)
```
```{r}
##similar case like above
mosaic(~cleaning_fee + room_type, data = train, shade = TRUE)
```
```{r}
#similar case like above
mosaic(~city + cleaning_fee, data = train, shade = TRUE)
```


```{r}
##these variables are highly significant
fourfold(xtabs(~ instant_bookable + cleaning_fee, data = train))
```


```{r}
##Those two conditions of cleaning fee(i.e. either yes or no) were studied through the use of boxplot to see their relationship with log_price 

ggplot(train, aes(x= cleaning_fee, y=log_price))+geom_boxplot()+ ggtitle("Boxplot for log_price vs cleaning_fee")


```

```{r}
train %>% group_by(bedrooms) %>% select(bedrooms) %>% unique()
count(train, bedrooms) %>% mutate(relative_freq = (n/sum(n)))
hist(train$bedrooms)
```
There is highest number of single bedroom./

```{r}
train$amenities
train$host_has_profile_pic
